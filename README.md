# Cognifyz Data Science Internship  

🚀 **Cognifyz Technologies – Where Data Meets Intelligence**  

This repository contains the tasks and projects completed during my **Data Science Internship** at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The internship focused on **data exploration, preprocessing, analysis, and modeling** to gain actionable insights.  

## 📌 Internship Tasks  

### 🔹 Level 1  
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing** – Checked dataset shape, missing values, data types, and target variable distribution.  
- **Descriptive Analysis** – Calculated stats, explored categorical variables, identified top cuisines & cities.  
- **Geospatial Analysis** – Visualized restaurant locations on map, analyzed location vs. rating.  
- **Table Booking & Delivery** – Compared ratings with/without booking, studied delivery trends by price range.  

### 🔹 Level 2  
- **Price Range Analysis** – Analyzed most common ranges & their ratings.  
- **Feature Engineering** – Created new features (e.g., booking/delivery flags, name/address length).  
- **Predictive Modeling** – Built ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict restaurant ratings.  

### 🔹 Level 3  
- **Customer Preference Analysis** – Studied cuisine vs. ratings, votes, and popularity.  
- **Data Visualization** – Created insightful plots (histograms, bar plots, maps) for cuisines, cities, and ratings.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Data Visualization Tools**
